    <h3>My first try at an ordered list</h3>
    <p>This will be my first attempt at making an ordered list. There is a difference between an ordered and an unordered list. My ordered list will be about pets I would like to have one day.
      <ol>
        <li>The Russian Blue Cat</li>
        <li>The Maine Coon</li>
        <li>The Czech Wolfhound</li>
        <li>The Cane Corso</li>
        <li>The Rottweiler</li>
        <li>The Congo Grey Parrot</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>My first try at an unordered list</h3>
    <p>Now I will attempt an unordered list. I will make the list using the same information that I used in my ordered list.
      <ul>
        <li>The Russion Blue Cat</li>
        <li>The Maine Coon</li>
        <li>The Czech Wolfhound</li>
        <li>The Cane Corso</li>
        <li>The Rottweiler</li>
        <li>The Congo Grey Parrot</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Why am I doing all of this?</h3>
    <p>I am doing this, practicing with code and trying out new things, because I think learning code can be of value. 
      I think that it is a useful tool to learn, and to learn to understand, 
      because it is something that can help you when you start working for yourself, for a business/company, or it might just be something that can help you be more creative. 
      <br>
      I hope that I will be able to help my dad with his business, and the upkeep of the website he has right now.</p>
